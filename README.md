#Steps to run my to-do-list website
Step 1: Download Project Files
        Download or clone the project repository to your computer.
        Open the project folder in a terminal (e.g., Hyper, VS Code Terminal, or any other terminal).

Step 2: Install Required Packages
        Run the command "npm install" to install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
        This will create a node_modules folder in your project directory containing the required packages.

Step 3: Start the MongoDB Server
        Open a new terminal window and type "mongod" to start the MongoDB server:
        Ensure MongoDB is installed and properly configured on your system.

Step 4: Start the Node.js Application
        Go back to the original terminal and type "node app.js" to start your application:
        You should see a confirmation message in the terminal, such as Server is running on port 3000.

Step 5: Access the Application in Your Browser
        Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000
        The main page of the To-Do List application will load.

Step 6: Use the To-Do List
        You can now: Add tasks to your list.
        Delete tasks from the list.
        Manage multiple lists by navigating to different routes.
        
Step 7: Create Additional Routes
        Experiment by adding new routes (e.g., /shopping, /work, etc.) in your browser:
        http://localhost:3000/shopping
        http://localhost:3000/work
        
Step 8: Stop the Application
When you're done, stop the Node.js application and MongoDB server by closing their respective terminals or using Ctrl+C in the terminal.
